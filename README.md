# MS Annika

MS Annika is a crosslink search engine based on [MS Amanda](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500202e), aimed at identifying crosslinks of cleavable and non-cleavable crosslinkers from MS2 and MS3 spectra.

*Please note that only MS Annika 3.0 (and above) supports identification of non-cleavable crosslinks and only MS Annika 2.0 (and above) supports identification from MS2-MS2-based acquisition workflows!*

## Installation

MS Annika is a plug-in for the proteomics software [Proteome Discover](https://www.thermofisher.com/at/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteome-discoverer-software.html)
by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Installation of MS Annika requires:

- Installation of Proteome Discoverer (can be downloaded for free from [here](https://www.thermofisher.com/at/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteome-discoverer-software.html))
  - (Requirements of Proteome Discoverer apply)
- Installation of MS Annika via the installer available from this repository
  - There are no additional requirements other than Proteome Discoverer
  - Users will be asked to accept the MS Annika license agreement (MS Annika is licensed as freeware)
  - The typical installation of MS Annika does not take longer than 5 minutes

The [tutorial](#Tutorial) also covers the installation in detail.

## Usage

MS Annika makes use of the workflow interface in Proteome Discoverer, which should be straight-forward to use. Step by step instructions for people
unfamiliar with Proteome Discoverer are given in the [tutorial](#Tutorial). The below sections also give an overview of parameters, results, example workflows and example data. Typically an analysis with MS Annika takes a few minutes for small samples and up to a few hours for larger samples and proteome-wide searches.

## Parameters & Results

Please refer to the [MS Annika User Manual](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/blob/master/MS_Annika_3.0_UserManual.pdf) for a detailed description of all MS Annika parameters as
well as descriptions of all result tables. For further down-stream analysis of MS Annika results we recommend taking a look at [MS Annika Extensions](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika_Extensions).

The provided workflows also require the installation of [MS Amanda](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500202e) which can be downloaded [here](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=ms-amanda).

The general processing workflow for almost any crosslink search is depicted [here](workflows/general_wf.png).

For MS2 searches (CID, ETD, HCD, stepped HCD) it can also be beneficial to employ the [IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=spectrum-processor) node, an example workflow for Proteome Discoverer 3.0 is given here:

- DSSO MS2 search with IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor: [pdAnalysis](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/raw/master/workflows/PD3.0/DSSO_IMP_MS2.pdAnalysis) / [zip](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/raw/master/workflows/PD3.0/DSSO_IMP_MS2.zip)

This workflow additionally requires the installation of the [IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=spectrum-processor) node beforehand, which can be directly downloaded from [here (Proteome Discoverer 3.0)](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?file=spectrum-processor/ms2spectrumprocessor_3.0.zip).

## Support for MGF and timsTOF Data

The following MS Annika versions support MGF\* and timsTOF\*\* data input:
- Proteome Discoverer 3.1: [MS Annika 2.0 v2.2.1](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/releases/tag/v2.2.1) or greater (e.g. [**latest**](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/raw/master/releases/latest/PD3.1/latest.zip))
- Proteome Discoverer 3.0: [MS Annika 2.0 v1.1.4fix](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/releases/tag/v1.1.4fix)
- Proteome Discoverer <=2.5: [MS Annika 1.0 v1.0.0](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/releases/tag/v1.0.0)\*\*\*

\*MS Annika 3.0 only supports MS2 search for MGF files since MGF files don't contain sufficient MS3 information.  
\*\*optionally requires installation of the Bruker Ion Mobility reader to display ion mobilities in Proteome Discoverer, the node is not needed for crosslink search.  
\*\*\*requires installation of the [IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=spectrum-processor) node.
